https://github.com/TryCatchHCF/PacketWhisper

PacketWhisper: Stealthily exfiltrate data and defeat attribution using DNS queries and text-based steganography. Avoid the problems      associated with typical DNS exfiltration methods. Transfer data between systems without the communicating devices directly connecting to    each other or to a common endpoint. No need to control a DNS Name Server.
