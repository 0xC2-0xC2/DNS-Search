## Why is this different from every other DNS exfiltration technique?

https://github.com/TryCatchHCF/PacketWhisper

PacketWhisper: Stealthily exfiltrate data and defeat attribution using DNS queries and text-based steganography. Avoid the problems      associated with typical DNS exfiltration methods. Transfer data between systems without the communicating devices directly connecting to    each other or to a common endpoint. No need to control a DNS Name Server.

## Preventing DNS Attacks: Tips and Best Practices

https://blog.101domain.com/domains/preventing-dns-attacks

The breakdown of common attack types goes like this:

76% are direct denial of service (DDoS) attacks – Also known as amplification attacks. They use several computers to issue a flood of requests to a server, causing it to overload and stop responding. DDoS attacks involve one attacking system and one server.

33% involve cache poisoning – Involves replacing legitimate cache information with faked or spoofed data to redirect users.

29% are DNS exploits – Attackers search for DNS vulnerabilities to find a weak point to penetrate the system.

29% involve UDP flooding – A form of DDoS DNS attack, these attacks overwhelm a targeted system until it can no longer respond.

24% are the result of DNS tunneling – Hackers embed malicious coding or programs in the DNS queries in an effort to commandeer the session and/or re-direct traffic.
